Django receives the URL, checks the urls.py file, and calls the view that matches the URL.
The view, located in views.py, checks for relevant models.
The models are imported from the modals.py file.
The view then sends the data to a specified template in the template folder.
The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.
